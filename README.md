# UnityTests
Place to store and access basic programs I made to learn the ins and outs of Unity

# Games

## Pong
Majority of this project is made through directions and assets provided by https://noobtuts.com. 
I added the original Pong sound effects to the game and a scoreboard by myself. 
I also added a (mostly) unbeatable AI without help from above website.
AI can be toggled on and off for either side.

#### What I Learned 
* This small project taught me the basics of components, hit detection, C# scripts, and how to navigate through Unity.

## Minesweeper
Another project made by following directions provided by https://noobtuts.com.
I improved the game's mechanics by putting in a flagging system and a victory screen once all bombs have been flagged.

#### What I Learned
* This project taught me how to manage a lot of GameObjects, implement changing sprite textures, and optimize game conditions.
